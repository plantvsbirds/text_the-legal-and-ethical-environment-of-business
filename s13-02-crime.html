    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_p01">Imagine that you work in a publicly traded corporation as an accountant. One day, your manager calls you. You sense desperation in his voice as he whispers, “Quick! Shred the paper copies of the financial records!” Will you do it? After all, how can shredding paper be a crime? Not so fast. It may be a crime under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, specifically if you destroy documents before the statutory length of time required to hold them. After studying this section, you should be able to recognize when the answer to such questions should be a resounding “No!” Indeed, after reading this section, you should be able to spot criminal activity, which may lead to tough decisions, such as whether you should be a whistleblower or not.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_p02">This section addresses crimes relevant to business concerns. A business must be concerned about criminal activity from the inside, from the outside, and through its own actions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">White-Collar Crime</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">White-collar crime</a><span class="glossdef">A term used to describe nonviolent crimes committed by people in their professional capacity or by organizations.</span></span> is a term used to describe nonviolent crimes committed by people in their professional capacity, or by organizations. These crimes are committed for financial gain, often through deception. Historically, this term derives from a reference to the “white collars” that managers, executives, or professionals who committed these crimes wore as their everyday attire, rather than the “blue collars” of the factory workers and laborers. White-collar crimes are not typical street crimes, like burglary or robbery, and they are not person crimes, like murder or rape. Rather, the term is used to describe crime committed in the professional work environment, for the purpose of obtaining a financial reward through the use of deception. White-collar criminals frequently commit their crimes on the job, in broad daylight, while sitting at a desk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_p02">But what leads an otherwise successful businessperson or organization to commit a white-collar crime? After all, if someone is earning a good salary, or if a business is financially healthy, why would he or she choose to violate the law? While names like Kenneth Lay of Enron and Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom are virtually synonymous with corporate greed, lack of ethical decision making, and fraudulent behavior, these examples do not provide satisfactory answers to this question. Indeed, businesses must be vigilant against white-collar crime, because there is no absolute way to identify those who might turn to criminal behavior in the workplace. White-collar crime can involve fraud or larceny, organized crime, cybercrime, and environmental crime.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p01">White-collar crimes generally involve the use of deception to acquire money or property. This is the very definition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fraud</a><span class="glossdef">The use of deception to acquire money or property.</span></span>. Many white-collar crimes are versions of fraud.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p02">Fraud is found in many contexts. For instance, many regulatory violations, like <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insider trading</a><span class="glossdef">A form of securities fraud.</span></span>, are forms of fraud. Specifically, these are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">securities fraud</a><span class="glossdef">Fraud committed in the context of investments regulated by the SEC.</span></span>. Securities fraud is when someone uses deception to circumvent the regulations or statutes interpreted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to acquire money or property. Goldman Sachs was recently charged by the SEC for securities fraud, because it allegedly misrepresented material facts to investors to gain financially. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_n01">Note 10.49 "Hyperlink: SEC v. Goldman Sachs"</a> to review the complaint.</p>

For instance, if someone falsely reports that her office was burglarized and her computer equipment was stolen, and asks her insurance company to cover the loss, then this constitutes insurance fraud.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p13">Consider another type of fraud, where the deception is perhaps better hidden. Bernie Madoff committed massive fraud in a scheme known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ponzi scheme</a><span class="glossdef">A pyramid scheme, which is a particular type of fraud.</span></span>. A Ponzi scheme is a pyramid scheme, where people pay in. Those at the top of the pyramid may receive something that appears to be a return on their investment, but those at the bottom do not. This is because the funds paid in by those at the bottom are used to pay the people at the top. Those who operate Ponzi schemes generally solicit investors, and those who invest in such schemes are expecting a legitimate return on investment (ROI). However, the master of the Ponzi scheme does not really invest the funds. He simply takes them, and keeps his early “investors” happy by bringing in new investors, whose money he gives to the old investors as their ROI. This allows the Ponzi scheme to continue, because it appears from the outside that investors are receiving a legitimate ROI. The problem is that the capital contributions eventually disappear, since they are never invested but are simply used by the criminal for his own purposes, including covering his tracks for as long as possible by paying investors with fake ROI payments as necessary. To continue, the pyramid must get bigger and bigger. That is because new investors must be attracted to keep the cash flow going. Eventually, of course, pyramids will eventually collapse under their own unsustainable structure. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_n04">Note 10.58 "Hyperlink: The Mechanics of a Pyramid Scheme"</a> for an illustration of a pyramid scheme from the SEC.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p15">Madoff was a wealth manager who defrauded investors out of billions of dollars. How does someone get away with this? Interestingly, Harry Markopolos, a financial analyst, flagged Madoff’s actions to the SEC as statistically impossible long before Madoff was caught. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_n05">Note 10.59 "Hyperlink: Too Good to Be True? Statistically Impossible Returns"</a> to watch Mr. Markopolos explain this by using sports analogies. This raises interesting legal questions regarding whether the SEC is proactive enough. The SEC actions are often reactive, responding to a situation after it happened.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p17">Investors aren’t the only potential victims of white-collar crime. Owners of businesses are also potential victims. For example, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embezzlement</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when someone takes property that was in his or her possession lawfully and then converts it to his or her own use.</span></span> is a common crime, and it occurs when someone takes property that was in his or her possession lawfully and then converts it to his or her own use. As you can see, Bernie Madoff was an embezzler because he lawfully had possession of his clients’ money, but then he wrongfully converted those funds to his own use, rather than exercising his fiduciary duty to his clients. Embezzlement differs from larceny, because larceny requires the trespassory taking of property with the intent to deprive the owner of the property. In other words, in a larceny, the thief is not supposed to have possession of the property to begin with. Someone who embezzles something, however, has the right to be in possession of the property to start with but then wrongfully converts it (steals it) for his or her own use. Embezzlement strategies can involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">forgery</a><span class="glossdef">A form of counterfeiting.</span></span>, which is counterfeiting someone else’s signature or other document. It can also involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wire fraud</a><span class="glossdef">Fraud committed over interstate wire, such as by telephone.</span></span> if the embezzlement uses electronic communications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_004">18 U.S.C. §1343.</span> Refer again to <a class="xref" href="lau-ch10_s01#lau-ch10_s01_n02">Note 10.4 "Hyperlink: Thefts, Skimming, Fake Invoices, Oh My!"</a> to learn about many different embezzlement schemes.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Organized Crime</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p01">While the term “organized crime” often summons images of the mafia, that is not the only type of organized criminal activity in this country. Consider the recent case against Pfizer, which settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009. Pfizer’s subsidiaries, Pharmacia and Upjohn, had been selling pharmaceuticals “off-label” in doses and for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and it had been providing kickbacks to physicians to prescribe those drugs. The subsidiaries agreed to plead guilty to misbranding with the intent to defraud or mislead. They paid a criminal fine of more than one billion dollars and forfeited their profits from their illegal activities. Not only did they plead guilty to a criminal violation, but they also had to pay a hefty penalty for violating civil law, particularly related to paying kickbacks to physicians.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_005">FBI Press Release, “The Case Against Pfizer: A Record $2.3 Billion Settlement,” September 2, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov/page2/sept09/pfizer_settlement_090209.html">http://www.fbi.gov/page2/sept09/pfizer_settlement_090209.html</a> (accessed September 27, 2010).</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Kickbacks</a><span class="glossdef">Incentive payments that are given to someone who makes decisions to encourage others to pay for something.</span></span> are incentive payments that are given to someone who makes decisions to encourage others to pay for something. The repercussions of this conviction are certainly felt by those who were without knowledge of these acts, such as the shareholders and many employees, not to mention the patients who were subjected to off-label marketing in the contexts of what otherwise should have been trusting relationships with their physicians.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal statute that penalizes racketeering activities.</span></span> is a federal statute that, if violated, can add substantial prison time to a convicted criminal’s sentence. Even if someone is not per se involved with organized crime, RICO charges can be brought against a defendant who has violated the statute. This statute punishes those engaged in a pattern (at least two) of racketeering activities—which include a wide range of activities typically associated with organized crime—over a ten-year period,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_006">18 U.S.C. §1961(5).</span> when funds from those activities were used to maintain, operate, or acquire a legitimate business. Racketeering activities include crimes such as loan-sharking, bookmaking, money laundering, counterfeiting, smuggling, blackmailing, human trafficking, and other similar crimes. Although RICO was written to target traditional organized crime, less than 10 percent of RICO cases filed have been against the mafia. RICO is now used against insurance companies, stock brokerages, tobacco companies, banks, and other large commercial enterprises. RICO also has a civil provision allowing a competitor to file RICO charges, which come with triple damages if the suit is successful.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bribery</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when someone pays a government official to influence his or her decision or actions in his or her official capacity for the benefit of the person paying the bribe.</span></span> occurs when someone pays a government official to influence the official’s decision or actions in his or her official capacity for the benefit of the person paying the bribe.

However, companies should be very careful in relying on the grease payment exception, since such payments are legal under the FCPA only if they are also legal under the laws of the country where the grease payments take place, and there are very few jurisdictions (if any) where they are indeed legal. States also have statutes against bribery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p04">Money laundering occurs when funds gained from illegal activities are processed through a seemingly legitimate business to “clean” the source of those funds. For example, someone who received $10,000 for criminal activities will need to “clean” the money to be able to use it legitimately. One way this can be done is by setting up a business that handles a lot of cash, which appears to be a legitimate business. This business can overstate its earnings by $10,000 over time by running the money through its books, thereby “cleaning” the funds. For example, if the business was a tavern, and the tavern grossed $12,000 per month, the ill-gotten $10,000 could be spread out over ten months by having the business claim that it grossed $13,000 each month. In that way, the ten thousand would eventually be “laundered” or “cleaned,” because it will appear to be money received by the legitimate business itself.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p05">In that example, if someone found out about this money laundering operation and threatened to go to the authorities unless a payment was given to him to keep quiet, then that would be a form of extortion known as blackmail. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Blackmail</a><span class="glossdef">A form of extortion that occurs when someone threatens to reveal a harmful truth, such as involvement in criminal activity, but agrees to remain silent if he is paid.</span></span> occurs when someone threatens to reveal a harmful truth, such as involvement in criminal activity, but agrees to remain silent if paid. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Extortion</a><span class="glossdef">When someone obtains property through coercion by threat of some future action.</span></span> is when someone obtains property through coercion. Another example of extortion is when a neighborhood gang extracts “protection payments” from local businesses. Essentially, the gang requires payment from local businesses periodically, and if the business refuses to pay, then the gang injures the business or its owner in some way, such as through vandalism or battery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p06">In organized crime cases, there can be strong incentives for people not to do the right thing. Maybe they are afraid of punishment by the government. But they may also fear punishment from their organized crime communities. In such cases, sometimes people do not tell the truth when they should. Someone who lies under oath, even if he or she thinks there’s a good reason to do so, has committed the crime of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perjury</a><span class="glossdef">Lying under oath.</span></span>.

For instance, corporations that illegally dump toxic substances into waterways, illegally harm endangered species or those species’ habitats, or trade in illegal substances that have been banned due to their propensity to cause great harm to the environment are all engaged in environmental crimes. U.S. federal environmental statutes that carry criminal penalties include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and the Endangered Species Act.

The sentence included a five-year probation for the business, a half-million-dollar criminal fine, and a four-hundred-thousand-dollar payment to a nonprofit organization.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s02_s02_p02">Crime is a very important consideration in the business world. White-collar crimes are particularly insidious because white-collar criminals work from the inside, can be difficult to spot since they often hold positions of trust, and use deception as their primary tool. Blue-collar crimes also pose substantial risk of loss for businesses. Fraud, cybercrime, environmental crime, organized crime, and various forms of property crimes are all serious threats to businesses. Crime carries high personal costs not only to the individuals involved in the misconduct but also to society at large, including the corporations and others who depend on those corporations.</p>
