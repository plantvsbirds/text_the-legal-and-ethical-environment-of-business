    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p02">Clint Eastwood had a long-term relationship with Sondra Locke. Sadly, the relationship deteriorated and, allegedly, ended on unfriendly terms. The couple never married, but they shared a household for many years, and they worked on many professional projects together. When the relationship ended, Locke sued Eastwood for various causes of action. To settle the case, Eastwood proposed, among other things, that if Locke dropped the lawsuit against him, he would secure a development deal for Locke at Warner Bros. Inc. Locke was not only an actress; she was also a director. No doubt assuming that this deal would advance her professional interests and, at the same time, bring a long-standing personal dispute to an end, Locke agreed. Locke entered into a settlement agreement with Eastwood, and as promised, she contemporaneously entered into an agreement with Warner Bros. The agreement with Warner Bros. had two components. First, it required Locke to submit work that she was interested in developing, before she submitted it elsewhere. Warner Bros. was to accept or reject the work within thirty days. For this part of the contract, Locke would receive $250,000 per year for three years. Second, the contract was a $750,000 “pay or play” deal, which gave Warner Bros. a choice between using Locke’s services as a director and paying Locke a fee. Though Locke did not know this, Eastwood agreed to reimburse Warner Bros. for the cost of this contract if she did not have success in developing her projects or using her director services. Warner Bros. paid the $1.5 million contemplated under the contract, but it did not develop any of Locke’s thirty proposed projects, and it did not hire her to direct any films.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p03">Locke argued that the agreement had been a sham, because Warner Bros. had never intended to make films with her. She also argued that its only motivation for entering into the contract with her was to help Eastwood in settling her earlier claims against him. Locke sued Warner Bros. for a number of claims, including a breach of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implied covenant</a><span class="glossdef">A promise the law requires in all contracts, regardless of whether the parties state it or not.</span></span> of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">good faith</a><span class="glossdef">Without deception; honest.</span></span> and fair dealing, and fraud. She alleged that she was deprived of the benefit of the bargain and that Warner Bros. had no intention of honoring its agreement with her. Warner Bros. won at trial, and Locke appealed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p04">The California Court of Appeals found that while the creative decisions of Warner Bros. were not appropriate for judicial review, acting in bad faith by refusing to consider the merits of Locke’s proposals was a matter for the courts. The court also noted that even though the contractual sum of money was paid, that alone did not constitute performance under the contract. Part of the value of the contract for Locke was the opportunity to work on projects that would earn additional money and promote and enhance Locke’s career. Moreover, the appellate court found that if Warner Bros. never intended to work with Locke but had entered into the contract solely to accommodate Eastwood, then a lack of good faith might be inferred.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn06_001"><em class="emphasis">Locke v. Warner Bros. Inc</em>., 57 Cal. App. 4th 354 (1997).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p05">What do you think about this case? After all, Locke was compensated the amount of money explicitly contemplated under the contract. Should it matter whether one party acts in good faith or not? We might say that this contract contains all necessary elements to be enforceable, and it looks on its face as if it has been performed. However, a lack of good faith by one party could lead to damages. After the court’s decision, the parties settled for an undisclosed amount.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p06">Contracts are a fundamental part of doing business. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract</a><span class="glossdef">A legally enforceable promise.</span></span> is a legally enforceable promise. As you know, breaking promises is a big deal. Ethical questions arise when promises are broken. For example, what if you promised to mow your elderly neighbor’s lawn because you wanted to help him, but then you never got around to doing it? Wouldn’t you feel guilty about watching his grass grow into tall weeds?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p07">When the promise is a legally enforceable promise, feeling guilty about breaking the promise is not the only fallout. When a legally enforceable promise is broken, the injured party can seek <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">damages</a><span class="glossdef">Compensable loss.</span></span>. In contracts, this usually means that the party who breaches the contract must pay the injured party an amount that would make that party whole again. Also, some people disagree about whether breaching a legally enforceable promise—that is, a contract—carries any ethical implications. For instance, if a company decides that it is less expensive to pay damages than fulfill its promise by performing under a contract, it might make the decision to breach based on rational decision making. That is, since it will be less expensive to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">breach</a><span class="glossdef">The failure to perform duties and obligations required by contract.</span></span>, it makes sense to breach. Others disagree with this approach, pointing out that reliance on promises is an important part of business that provides necessary stability, regardless of whether keeping the promise makes economic sense or not.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p08">If you had a business, would you breach a contract to save money? Why or why not?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p09">Contracts are agreements between two or more parties. Generally speaking, contracts are a form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">private law</a><span class="glossdef">A legally binding agreement between consenting parties that does not apply to the public at large.</span></span>, because the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">terms</a><span class="glossdef">Elements of contracts that specify important matters, such as quantity, price, and time for performance.</span></span> of the contract are binding on those parties but not on everyone. The contract represents <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mutual assent</a><span class="glossdef">In common-law contracts, comprises offer and acceptance.</span></span> to a bargained-for exchange between parties.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p10">Generally speaking, in the United States parties may enter into contracts for whatever they wish and under any terms that they agree on. In other words, parties may assent to agreements even if those agreements represent bad bargains. However, there are certain external restrictions on our abilities to form contracts. Additionally, certain internal (to the contract) restrictions may exist on our abilities to exercise rights or to engage in other contracts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p11">Legal restrictions, external to the contract, limit our ability to bargain. For example, if you wanted to hire someone to work for your company, you could not contract with that person to work one-hundred-hour workweeks at twenty-five cents per hour. Even if you could find someone to work under those conditions and even if you both agreed to those terms of the contract, our statutory and regulatory laws prohibit you from entering into a contract with those terms. Such wages would violate minimum wage laws.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch06_p12">There may also be restrictions that are internal to the contract. Imagine that you entered into an employment contract with a company to work for $55,000 per year, plus benefits, and for a term of two years. You might be pretty happy about that. But what if, one month later, another company offered you the same position at its company, but for a salary of $65,000 per year, plus benefits. The better offer does not invalidate your first contract. In fact, in such a case, your first contract would probably contain a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noncompete clause</a><span class="glossdef">A contract clause that restricts competition for a specified period of time, within a certain geographic region, and for specified activities.</span></span> that would prohibit you from working in a similar capacity for a specified length of time and geographic area. So even if you decided to breach your first contract to enter into the second, you would be prohibited from doing so under the noncompete clause.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lau-ch06_p13">Contracts are legally enforceable promises that, if breached, result in compensable damages. Contracts are a fundamental part of doing business, which require not only performance of the terms of the contract but also good faith in dealing. Parties may enter into a contract for any agreement with terms, providing the agreement is legal. Also, restrictions on ability to contract may be external, such as those imposed by law, or they may be internal, such as those imposed by clauses like noncompete agreements.</p>
