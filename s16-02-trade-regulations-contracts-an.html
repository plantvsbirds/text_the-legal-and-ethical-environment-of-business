            <li>Examine U.S. trade regulations.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_p01">Several U.S. laws apply to U.S. companies conducting business internationally. For example, trade regulations are relevant to importers and exporters of products. Also, some activities are prohibited to U.S. businesses, such as doing business with a terrorist organization. It is important for all companies contemplating doing business in the international environment to understand the laws that apply to their activities so that they can avoid criminal and civil liability, and maintain a commitment to ethics.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Trade Regulations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p01">The removal or reduction of trade barriers in accordance with the former <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</a><span class="glossdef">An international treaty that worked to reduced trade barriers.</span></span> and most recently the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">World Trade Organization</a><span class="glossdef">Created by the GATT, it addresses trade between nations, including dispute resolution.</span></span> presents opportunities for businesses. Likewise, multinational agreements that remove trade barriers to create largely duty-free and tariff-free trading zones, such as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">North American Free Trade Agreement</a><span class="glossdef">A trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico.</span></span>, allow for freer flow of goods and services between specific countries. These agreements create tremendous opportunities for businesses because they lower the costs associated with importing and exporting, which is a primary consideration for many companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Companies wishing to export or import products are subject to federal trade regulations. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Export controls</a><span class="glossdef">Controls that prohibit or restrict the export of certain types of products.</span></span> prohibit or restrict the export of certain types of products while limiting or restricting specific products from entering a country, perhaps by way of tariffs or quotas. The U.S. government views exporting as a privilege and not as a right and has the authority to impose a total ban on exporting on U.S. companies for export control violations. Try to imagine what an export ban would do to companies such as Microsoft, Boeing, or Apple.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p03">The activities of companies that ship products overseas are subject to federal export controls. To <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">export</a><span class="glossdef">To transport products to another country.</span></span> simply means to transport products to another country. Export controls are regulated by several departments of the federal government. For example, the Export Administration Regulations are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and they regulate items that may have a dual commercial or military use, such as computers and electronics. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control regulates and enforces trade sanctions. The U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulation prohibits certain types of trade, such as the unlicensed export of weaponry and certain chemicals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p04">Other federal agencies and programs exist in a supportive capacity, to assist U.S. businesses in their export endeavors rather than to regulate and enforce export controls. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration supports U.S. exports and competitiveness abroad.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p09">Companies wishing to import products are also subject to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">import controls</a><span class="glossdef">Controls that limit or restrict specific products from entering a country.</span></span>. Import controls take many forms including tariffs, quotas, and bans or restrictions. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBA) has a primary role in import control administration and regulation. For example, it inspects imports to classify them to establish their tariff schedule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p10">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tariff</a><span class="glossdef">An import tax.</span></span> applies to certain goods imported from other countries. Tariffs are import taxes. They are imposed to render the imported product more expensive and to keep the cost of nonimported products (domestic products) attractive to consumers. CBA customs officers classify the imported goods, which determines the applicable tariff. However, the Customs Modernization and Informed Compliance Act places responsibility for compliance with import laws on the importer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p11"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quotas</a><span class="glossdef">Limits on quantity.</span></span> apply to certain goods. Quotas are simply limits on quantity. No absolute quotas exist, but certain tariff rate quotas apply to certain items, such as specific types of textiles and dairy products. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tariff rate quota</a><span class="glossdef">A favorable tariff on certain quantities of particular types of imports.</span></span> simply provides favorable tariffs on certain quantities of particular types of imports.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p12"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bans</a><span class="glossdef">Prohibit importation of certain items by law.</span></span> apply to goods that are prohibited by law to import, because they are dangerous to public safety, health, the environment, or national interests. Other items are restricted from import. For example, it is illegal to import items of cultural heritage from other countries without permission. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch13_s02_s01_n03">Note 13.28 "Hyperlink: What? These Old Rocks?"</a> to see a recent story about 525-million-year-old fossils that were illegally imported into the United States and have been returned to China.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s01_p14">Along with the CBA, the U.S. International Trade Commission investigates import injuries to the United States, such as dumping and subsidized imports, and the need for safeguards. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Dumping</a><span class="glossdef">When a foreign producer exports products to sell at prices less than its cost of manufacturing.</span></span> is when a foreign producer exports products to sell at prices less than its cost of manufacturing. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Subsidized imports</a><span class="glossdef">Products produced in a foreign land in which a government has provided financial assistance for the production.</span></span> are products produced overseas for which a government has provided financial assistance for the production.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Contracts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s02_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">U.N.

It is not a law until state legislatures adopt it as law.</span></span>, it creates a uniform law for the parties that adopt it. Specifically, the CISG applies to contracts for international sale of commercial goods. Additionally, like the UCC, it provides gap-fillers for terms that may not be expressly stated in the contract. However, important differences between the UCC and the CISG exist, particularly with respect to revocability of an offer, acceptance, the requirement for a writing to be enforceable, and essential terms. See <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch13_s02_s02_f01">Figure 13.7 "A Comparison of Differences between the CISG and the UCC"</a> for a comparison between the CISG and the UCC.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn13_005">U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce, “The U.N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s02_p02">The CISG does not limit the parties to a particular forum to resolve disputes, and it does not limit the terms of the contract itself.

If parties opt out of the CISG, then they must choose which law will apply to their contract by a choice of law clause. The parties will also need to agree on the official language of the contract. Given the precise language necessary for contractual agreements to be interpreted, this choice clearly matters to the interests of the contracting parties.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Employment Law and Human Rights</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s03_p01">U.S. citizens that are working for U.S. companies overseas are protected by U.S. federal employment laws, such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act</a><span class="glossdef">An important federal statute that prohibits illegal discrimination.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a><span class="glossdef">A federal statute that prohibits illegal discrimination.</span></span>.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s04_p01">Those engaged in international business must be aware of prohibited activities, because severe criminal penalties are possible. For example, paying bribes to get things done is not permitted. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal statute that prohibits the payment of bribes by U.S. companies and the employees of those companies.</span></span> prohibits the payment of bribes by U.S. companies and the employees of those companies.

It does, however, permit <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grease payments</a><span class="glossdef">Facilitating payments that are not bribes.</span></span>, or facilitating payments, if such payments are permitted by the local government where the payments occurred. Since it is extremely rare to find a jurisdiction that legally permits grease payments (even in countries where corruption is rampant, it’s probably still illegal), the grease payments exception provides false comfort to those who undertake to use it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch13_s02_s04_p02">U.S. citizens and companies must refrain from doing business with prohibited people or entities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains a list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, which is a list of persons, businesses, and entities with which U.S. citizens are forbidden from conducting business. Similarly, U.S. citizens are not permitted to engage in trade or business dealings with those in countries in which a U.S. embargo or U.S. imposed economic sanctions exists. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch13_s02_s04_n01">Note 13.42 "Hyperlink: Prohibited Parties"</a> for these lists.</p>
