    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_p02">Consider the photo in <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_f01">Figure 10.1 "Businessperson in Trouble"</a>. It is probably not the usual image conjured by most business students who dream of success in the business world. Yet it becomes a sad reality for too many managers and executives who commit crimes in the context of their professional lives. How can the path from business success lead to a criminal conviction? Click on any credible news source today, and you will find among the headlines a story in which this photo would fit.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_p03">Of course, there are many reasons why something like this happens. People sometimes fall into the “wrong crowd” at work, and they do not know how to walk away. Sometimes corporate culture and leadership can contaminate a work environment, causing people to disregard ethical behavior or to flagrantly ignore the laws. If “everyone is doing it,” then someone might believe that it’s OK for him or her to do it, too. Being part of an organization has a way of making someone feel insulated and “safe” when committing wrongdoings. For example, some members of the Enron workforce seemed to be swept up in a culture of corporate greed, and they did not know how to walk away. Other people are opportunists, and their moral compass or ethics do not lead them away from temptation. Bernie Madoff may be a prime example of such an opportunist in today’s news. Sometimes, criminal behavior results from the emphasis of profit over ethical behavior. For example, we might think of corporate environmental crimes, in which corporations decide not to follow regulatory requirements regarding hazardous waste disposal or storage. In the end, of course, the reasons for the criminal behavior do not matter. When a crime is committed, others will be injured, and the wrongdoer will be subject to criminal prosecution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_p04">Everyone must be diligent about crime. Crimes affect businesses both from the inside and from the outside. Even if individuals are honest in their dealings, that does not relieve them from the necessity to maintain a vigilant watch to protect not only their good name but also that of their business from the criminal activities of others. Criminal activity “from the outside” can be costly to businesses. Loss through property damage, theft, shoplifting, corporate espionage, fraud, and arson are real threats. Perhaps more insidiously, threats “from the inside” also pose tremendous risk of loss. These activities include crimes such as embezzlement, computer crimes, and fraud. Such “inside jobs” are perhaps more unsettling because the perpetrators are often trusted colleagues who would not ordinarily fall under the suspicion of others. Moreover, a corporation must also protect itself from the bad judgment or overzealous behavior of its employees. If an employee acting within the scope of employment commits a crime from which the corporation itself will benefit, then the corporation can be convicted of the crime, too. Of course, not all corporations that are convicted on criminal charges are hapless victims of an overzealous employee who commits crimes on their behalf. Other businesses are actively involved in crime, whether through a corporate culture run amok or through outright organized crime, such as money laundering.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_p05">Let’s explore criminal law in the business world. Not only do we need to understand basic criminal law and the nature of crime in business to understand everyday headlines, but we also must ensure that our own professional dealings and the people associated with our businesses are never the legitimate focus of such stories. This chapter explores the differences between criminal law and civil law, the nature of criminal law, the constitutional protections afforded to those accused of committing a crime, relevant defenses, consequences of committing crimes, and the goals of punishment. It also examines specific crimes relevant to business, including white-collar crime, blue-collar crime that harms businesses, and crimes committed by businesses. Last, it examines different strategies to minimize exposure to criminal liability.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_p06">Criminal law is relevant to business because crime presents real threats. When crimes are committed, people are injured. Criminal behavior is punishable by law. Risks to business posed by crime arise from the losses suffered from the criminal activities of those on the outside of the business organization, as well as those on the inside. Corporations themselves can be liable for crime when an employee working within the scope of employment commits crime that benefits the corporation, or when the corporation itself commits crime.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p01">Imagine a bookkeeper who works for a physicians group. This bookkeeper’s job is to collect invoices that are due and payable by the physicians group and to process the payments for those invoices. The bookkeeper realizes that the physicians themselves are very busy, and they seem to trust the bookkeeper with the task of figuring out what needs to be paid. She decides to create a fake company, generate bogus invoices for “services rendered,” and send the invoices to the physicians group for payment. When she processes payment for those invoices, the fake company deposits the checks in its bank account—a bank account she secretly owns. This is a fraudulent disbursement, and it is just one of many ways in which crime occurs in the workplace.

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p04">When crime occurs in the workplace or in the context of business, the temptation might be to think that no one is “really” injured. After all, insurance policies can cover some losses. Sometimes people think that if the victims of embezzlement do not immediately notice the embezzlement, then they must not “need” the money anyhow, so no real crime has been committed. Of course, these excuses are just smoke screens. When an insurance company has to pay for a claim arising from a crime, the insurance company is injured, as are the victim and society at large. Similarly, the fact that wealthy people or businesses do not notice embezzlement immediately does not mean that they are not entitled to retain their property. Crime undermines confidence in social order and the expectations that we all have about living in a civil society. No crime is victimless.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p05">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crime</a><span class="glossdef">A public injury.</span></span> is a public injury. At the most basic level, criminal statutes reflect the rules that must be followed for a civil society to function. Crimes are an offense to civil society and its social order. In short, crimes are an offense to the public, and someone who commits a crime has committed an injury to the public.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p06">Criminal law differs from civil law in several important ways. See <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s01_f02">Figure 10.3 "Comparison between Criminal Law and Civil Law"</a> for a comparison. For starters, since crimes are public injuries, they are punishable by the government. It is the government’s responsibility to bring charges against criminals. In fact, private citizens may not prosecute each other for crimes. When a crime has been committed—for instance, if someone is the victim of fraud—then the government collects the evidence and files charges against the defendant. When someone is charged with committing a crime, he or she is charged by the government in an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indictment</a><span class="glossdef">A formal document in which the government accuses a legal person of a crime.</span></span>. The victim of the crime is a witness for the government but not for the prosecutor of the case. Note that our civil tort system allows a victim to bring a civil suit against someone for injuries inflicted on the victim by someone else. Indeed, criminal laws and torts often have parallel causes of action. Sometimes these claims carry the same or similar names. For instance, a victim of fraud may bring a civil action for fraud and may also be a witness for the state during the criminal trial for fraud.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p07">In a criminal case, the defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty. This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">presumption of innocence</a><span class="glossdef">The presumption made about any criminal defendant prior to verdict. Criminal defendants do not have to prove their innocence.</span></span> means that the state must prove the case against the defendant before the government can impose punishment. If the state cannot prove its case, then the person charged with the crime will be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">acquitted</a><span class="glossdef">To be found not guilty of a crime.</span></span>. This means that the defendant will be released, and he or she may not be tried for that crime again. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">burden of proof</a><span class="glossdef">A duty to prove. In a criminal trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution. In a civil trial, the burden of proof is usually the plaintiff’s burden.</span></span> in a criminal case is the prosecution’s burden, and the prosecution must prove its case <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beyond a reasonable doubt</a><span class="glossdef">The standard of proof in a criminal trial. It means that the evidence must be so compelling that there is no reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.</span></span>. This means that the defendant does not have to prove anything, because the burden is on the government to prove its case. Additionally, the evidence must be so compelling that there is no reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt. To be convicted of a crime, someone must possess the required criminal state of mind, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mens rea</a><span class="glossdef">A guilty mind, or a criminal state of mind.</span></span>. Likewise, the person must have committed a criminal act, known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">actus reus</a><span class="glossdef">The guilty act, or the criminal action.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p08">Compare this to the standard of proof in a civil trial, which requires the plaintiff to prove the case only by a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preponderance of the evidence</a><span class="glossdef">The standard of proof in a civil trial. It means that the evidence that supports the claim is more likely than not.</span></span>. This means that the evidence to support the plaintiff’s case is greater (or weightier) than the evidence that does not. It’s useful to think of the criminal standard of proof—beyond a reasonable doubt—as something like 99 percent certainty, with 1 percent doubt. Compare this to preponderance of the evidence, which we might think of as 51 percent in favor of the plaintiff’s case, but up to 49 percent doubt. This means that it is much more difficult to successfully prosecute a criminal defendant than it is to bring a successful civil claim. Since a criminal action and a civil action may be brought against a defendant for the same incident, these differences in burdens of proof can result in verdicts that seem, at first glance, to contradict each other. Perhaps the most well-known cases in recent history in which this very outcome happened were the O. J. Simpson trials. Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial, but he was found liable for wrongful death in a subsequent civil action. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s01_n03">Note 10.14 "Hyperlink: Not Guilty Might Not Mean Innocent"</a> for a similar result in the business context.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Hyperlink: Not Guilty Might Not Mean Innocent</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s01_p09"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a89tFKR4OevM">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a89tFKR4OevM</a></p>
        <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s01_p10">Richard Scrushy of HealthSouth was acquitted of several criminal charges relating to accounting fraud but was found civilly liable for billions. He was subsequently found guilty in a later criminal case for different crimes committed.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_p11">This extra burden reflects the fact that the defendant in a criminal case stands to lose much more than a defendant in a civil case. Even though it may seem like a very bad thing to lose one’s assets in a civil case, the loss of liberty is considered to be a more serious loss. Therefore, more protections are afforded to the criminal defendant than are afforded to defendants in a civil proceeding. Because so much is at stake in a criminal case, our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">due process</a><span class="glossdef">A constitutional guarantee of fairness by procedure.</span></span> requirements are very high for anyone who is a defendant in criminal proceedings. Due process procedures are not specifically set out by the Constitution, and they vary depending on the type of penalty that can be levied against someone. For example, in a civil case, the due process requirements might simply be notice and an opportunity to be heard. If the government intends to revoke a professional license, then the defendant might receive notice by way of a letter, and the opportunity to be heard might exist by way of written appeal. In a criminal case, however, the due process requirements are higher. This is because a criminal case carries the potential for the most serious penalties.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Constitutional Rights Relevant to Criminal Proceedings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p01">A person accused of a crime has several rights, which are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Many crimes are state law issues. However, many provisions of the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights, which contains the rights of concern to criminal defendants, have been incorporated as applicable to the states. This is known as the incorporation doctrine.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p02">The Sixth Amendment guarantees that criminal defendants are entitled to an attorney during any phase of a criminal proceeding where there is a possibility of incarceration. This means that if a defendant cannot afford an attorney, then one is appointed for him or her at the state’s expense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p03">The Fifth Amendment guarantees the right to avoid self-incrimination. This right means that the government cannot torture someone accused of committing a crime. Obviously, someone under the physical and psychological pain of torture will admit to anything, and this might be a strong incentive to allow torture if the government wanted someone to confess to a crime. However, the Fifth Amendment guarantees that people can choose to remain silent. No one is compelled to testify against himself or herself to make self-incriminating statements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p04">The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. We do not employ many techniques that were once used to punish people who committed crimes. For instance, we do not draw and quarter people, which was a practice in England during the Middle Ages. Recently, however, the question of the use of torture by the United States against aliens on foreign soil has been a hot topic. Many people believe that our Eighth Amendment protections should be extended to everyone held by U.S. authorities, whether they are on U.S. soil or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p05">The Fourth Amendment provides a prohibition against illegal searches and seizures. This means that if evidence were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, then it cannot be used against the defendant in a court of law. For Fourth Amendment requirements to be met, the government must first obtain a search warrant to search a particular area for particular items if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area to be searched. The search warrant is issued only on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">probable cause</a><span class="glossdef">The standard required for a search warrant to be issued. It arises when there is enough evidence, such as through corroborating evidence, to reasonably lead to the belief that someone has committed a crime.</span></span>. Probable cause arises when there is enough evidence, such as through corroborating evidence, to reasonably lead to the belief that someone has committed a crime.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p06">If a valid search warrant is issued, then the government may search in the area specified by the warrant for the item that is the subject of the warrant. If a search occurs without a warrant, the search might still be legal, however. This is because there are several exceptions to the requirements for a search warrant. These include the plain view doctrine, exigent circumstances, consent, the automobile exception, lawful arrest, and stop and frisk. The plain view doctrine means that no warrant is required to conduct a search or to seize evidence if it appears in the plain view of a government agent, like a police officer. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exigent circumstances</a><span class="glossdef">An exception to the warrant requirement, specifically when an emergency exists, such as a hot pursuit.</span></span> mean that no warrant is required in the event of an emergency. For instance, if someone is cruelly beating his dog, the state can remove the dog without a warrant to seize the dog. The exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement is used in hot pursuit cases. For example, if the police are in hot pursuit of a suspect who flees into a house, the police can enter the house to continue the pursuit without having to stop to first obtain a warrant to enter the house. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Consent</a><span class="glossdef">An exception to the warrant requirement, in which a person with valid authority permits a search to proceed without a warrant.</span></span> means that the person who has the authority to grant consent for a search or seizure has granted the consent. This does not necessarily have to be the owner of the location to be searched. For example, if your roommate consents to a search of your living room, which is a common area shared by you and your roommate, then that is valid consent, even if the police find something incriminating against you and you or your landlord did not consent to the search. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">automobile exception</a><span class="glossdef">An exception to the warrant requirement, specifically when the vehicle is detained pursuant to a lawful stop.</span></span> means that an automobile may be searched if it has been lawfully stopped. When a police officer approaches a stopped car at night and shines a light into the interior of the car, the car has been searched. No warrant is required. If the police officer spots something that is incriminating, it may be seized without a warrant. Additionally, no warrant is required to search someone who is subject to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lawful arrest</a><span class="glossdef">An exception to the warrant requirement, specifically referring to a pat-down search permitted when someone is lawfully arrested.</span></span>. This exception exists to protect the police officer. For instance, if the police could not search someone who was just arrested, they would be in peril of injury from any weapon that the person in custody might have possession of. Similarly, if someone is stopped lawfully, that person may be frisked without a warrant. This is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stop and frisk</a><span class="glossdef">An exception to the warrant requirement, specifically permitted when a person is stopped for some permissible purpose by law enforcement officers. Allows a pat-down search or a “frisk.”</span></span> exception to the warrant requirement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s01_p07">In the business context, it is also important to note that administrative agencies in certain limited circumstances may conduct warrantless searches of closely regulated businesses, such as junkyards, where many stolen cars are disassembled for parts that can be sold.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Defenses</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02_p01">If the government violates a defendant’s constitutional rights when collecting evidence, then the evidence gathered in violation of those rights may be suppressed at trial. In other words, it may not be used against the defendant in trial. This is because evidence obtained through an illegal search is “fruit of the poisonous tree.” The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exclusionary rule</a><span class="glossdef">A means to suppress evidence that was obtained illegally.</span></span>. You should know, however, that lying to the defendant, or using forms of trickery and deceit, are not constitutional violations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02_p02">Another common defense arises under the exclusionary rule regarding confessions. This is when the government, while holding someone in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">custodial interrogation</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when a suspect is in custody, which means that the suspect cannot leave, and subject to interrogation, which means that words spoken or actions undertaken by government officials are likely to induce a response.</span></span>, questions that person without first reading the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Miranda warnings</a><span class="glossdef">Read to persons in custody, so that they are made aware of some of their constitutional rights. Failure to read Miranda warnings when someone is subject to a custodial interrogation may render statements uttered by the suspect inadmissible under the exclusionary rule.</span></span>. If someone is subjected to a custodial interrogation, he or she must first be read the Miranda warnings, which you have probably heard in the movies. Though the U.S. Supreme Court did not script the warnings specifically, the warnings are usually delivered in language close to this: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything that you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you by the state. Do you understand your rights?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02_p03">The purpose of the Miranda warnings is to ensure that people understand that they have the right not to make self-incriminating statements and that they have the right to have counsel. If someone wants to invoke his or her rights, he or she has to do so unequivocally. “Don’t I need a lawyer?” is not enough.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02_p04">The Miranda warnings are not required unless someone is in custody and subject to interrogation. Someone in custody is not free to leave. So if a police officer casually strikes up a conversation with you while you are shopping in the grocery store and you happen to confess to a crime, that confession will be admissible as evidence against you even though you were not Mirandized. Why? Because you were not in custody and you were free to leave at any time. Likewise, if the police are not interrogating a person, then any statement made can also be used against that person, even if he or she is not Mirandized. Someone is being interrogated when the statements or actions by the police (or other government agent) are likely to give rise to a response.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s02_p05">Another defense provided by the U.S. Constitution is the prohibition against <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double jeopardy</a><span class="glossdef">This means that the government may not prosecute someone twice for the same offense. It is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</span></span>. The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from prosecuting the same defendant for the same crime after he or she has already stood trial for it. This means that the government must do a very thorough job in collecting evidence prior to bringing a charge against a defendant, because unless the trial results in a hung jury, the prosecution will get only that one chance to prosecute the defendant.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Punishment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p01">If convicted in a criminal case, the defendant will be punished by the government, rather than by the victim. Once a defendant is convicted of a crime, he or she is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">criminal</a><span class="glossdef">A legal person convicted of a crime.</span></span>. Punishment for criminal offenses can include fines, restitution, forfeiture, probation, civil disabilities, and a loss of liberty. Loss of liberty means that the convicted criminal may be forced to do community service, may be subject to house arrest, may be incarcerated or, in some states that have the death penalty, may even lose his or her life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p02">Length of incarceration varies depending on whether the conviction was for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">misdemeanor</a><span class="glossdef">A criminal offense that is less serious than a felony but more serious than an infraction.</span></span> or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felony</a><span class="glossdef">A serious criminal offense, punishable with a prison sentence of more than one year or, in some circumstances, death.</span></span>. A misdemeanor is a less serious offense than a felony, as determined by the legislative body and reflected in the relevant statutes. Even an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infraction</a><span class="glossdef">A criminal offense, which is less serious than a misdemeanor.</span></span>, such as a parking ticket, is a criminal offense, typically carrying a penalty of a fine. An infraction is considered less serious than a misdemeanor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p03">When someone is convicted of violating a state criminal statute—a felony, misdemeanor, or infraction—the penalty will be set by the statute. For instance, the statute might state that the punishment will be “up to $5,000” or “up to one year in jail.” Often, the possible punishments are given in a range, which allows the judge leeway to take other matters into consideration when sentencing the offender. For example, if someone is convicted of a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to one year in jail, but that person is a first-time offender with no prior criminal history, the judge might impose a sentence of some lesser time in jail, such as thirty days, or no jail time whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p04">Historically, all judges had the leeway to use their judgment when sentencing convicted criminals. However, disparities in sentences gave rise to concern about unequal treatment for similar offenses. In the 1980s the U.S. Sentencing Commission established the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a><span class="glossdef">Created by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to provide advisory guidelines to federal judges when sentencing criminals.</span></span>, which were understood to be mandatory guidelines that federal judges were expected to use when sentencing offenders. The mandatory nature of these guidelines led some to observe that extremely harsh penalties were mandated for relatively minor offenses, given certain circumstances. Today, however, the federal guidelines are only advisory, due to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em class="emphasis">United States v. Booker</em>, which held that a wide range of factors should be taken into consideration when sentencing offenders.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_001"><em class="emphasis">United States v. Booker</em>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).</span> This opinion restored to federal district court judges the power to exercise their judgment when sentencing federal offenders. Several states, however, passed their own versions of sentencing guidelines, and state trial court judges in those states must rely on those guidelines when sentencing state offenders. This has led to controversial “three strikes” laws, which can also carry extremely harsh penalties—such as incarceration for twenty-five years to life—for relatively minor offenses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p05">Often, the convicted criminal will be subject to various civil disabilities, depending on the state in which he or she lives. For instance, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felon</a><span class="glossdef">A legal person convicted of a felony.</span></span>, which is a criminal that has been convicted of a felony, may be prohibited from possessing firearms, running for public office, sitting on a jury, holding a professional license, or voting. A felon may be subject to deportation if he or she is an illegal immigrant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s03_p06">Besides loss of liberty and civil disabilities, other forms of punishment exist. Some of these are also appropriate in civil cases. Punishment for crimes also includes a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fine</a><span class="glossdef">A monetary penalty.</span></span>, which is a monetary penalty for committing an offense.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose of Punishment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s04_p01">Conviction of a crime carries criminal penalties, such as incarceration. But what is the purpose of punishment? We do not have a vigilante system, where victims may bring their own form of justice to an offender. If we had such a system we would have never-ending feuds, such as the infamous and long-standing nineteenth-century dispute between the Hatfields and McCoys from the borderlands of West Virginia and Kentucky.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s04_p02">Several goals could be the focus of a criminal justice system. These could include retribution, punishment, rehabilitation, the protection of society, or deterrence from future acts of crime. Our criminal justice system’s penalties ostensibly do not exist for the purpose of retribution. Rather, rehabilitation, punishment, the protection of society, and deterrence from committing future crimes are the oft-cited goals. The Federal Bureau of Prisons captures some of these concepts in its mission statement.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_002">Federal Bureau of Prisons, “Mission and Vision of the Bureau of Prisons,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bop.gov/about/mission.jsp">http://www.bop.gov/about/mission.jsp</a> (accessed September 27, 2010).</span> Sadly, rehabilitation programs are not always available or, when they are, they are not always considered appropriate—or, when appropriate, they do not always work. Additionally, the goal of deterrence is not always achieved, as reflected in high recidivism rates in the United States.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Punishment of Business-Related Crime</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p01">Punishments committed by “white-collar criminals” are the same as those committed by any criminal. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">White-collar crime</a><span class="glossdef">A term used to describe nonviolent crimes committed by people in their professional capacity or by organizations.</span></span> is a term used to describe nonviolent crimes committed by people in their professional capacity or by organizations. Individuals involved in white-collar crime are criminally liable for their own actions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p02">Additionally, since a corporation is a legal person, then the corporation can be convicted of committing crimes, too. Accordingly, corporations can be punished. However, not all constitutional protections afforded to individuals are available to corporations. For instance, a corporation does not have the right against self-incrimination.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p03">One difficulty that arises is the question of how to punish a corporation for engaging in criminal activity. After all, as they say, a corporation does not have a soul to rehabilitate or a body to incarcerate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_003">Albert W. Alschuler, “Two Ways to Think about the Punishment of Corporations,” <em class="emphasis">American Criminal Law Review, Public Law and Legal Theory Series</em>, No. 09-19, 2009, p. 13, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1491263">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1491263</a> (accessed September 27, 2010).This is a paraphrase of a remark first uttered by Lord Chancellor Thurlow between 1778 and 1792: “No soul to damn, no body to kick.”</span> This is very different from a human being, who will stand to lose his or her liberty or who might be subject to mandatory counseling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p04">We might argue that a criminal corporation should have its corporate charter revoked, which would be equivalent to a corporate death penalty. However, if that happened, a lot of innocent people who were not involved in the criminal activity would be harmed. For instance, employees would lose their jobs, and suppliers and customers would lose the goods or services of the corporate criminal. Entire communities could suffer the consequences of a few bad actors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p05">On the other hand, corporations must be punished to respect the goal of deterrence of future crimes. One way that corporations are deterred is by the imposition of hefty fines. It is not uncommon to base such penalties on some percentage of profits, or all profits derived from the ill-gotten gains of criminal activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p06">Corporations that are criminals also lose much in the way of reputation. Of course, reputational damage can be very difficult to repair.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s01_s05_p07">Crime is a public injury. Criminal law differs from civil law in important ways, including who brings the claim, the burden of proof, due process, postconviction civil disabilities, and penalties. Those who are accused of committing a crime are afforded a high level of due process, including constitutional protections against illegal searches and seizures, and self-incrimination; guarantee of an attorney; and prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Several common defenses to crimes exist. If convicted, criminals can face loss of liberty, with sentencing structures based on statutory language and, in the federal system, guided by the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The goals of imposing penalties for violating criminal laws include protecting society, punishing the offender, rehabilitating the offender, and deterrence from future acts of crime. Corporations can also be convicted of crimes, though unique questions relating to appropriate means of punishment arise in that context.</p>

                <li>What kinds of crimes do college students commit? While the vast majority of college students wouldn’t even think of committing a violent crime, many students do engage in crimes they believe to be victimless, such as downloading movies or buying and selling prescription drugs like Adderall or Ritalin. Are these crimes actually victimless?</li>
                <li>The exclusionary rule was created by the Supreme Court as a means of punishing the police for violating a defendant’s constitutional rights. Some legal commentators, including several members of the Supreme Court, believe the exclusionary rule should be abolished. Without it, how do you think society can ensure the police will not violate a citizen’s constitutional rights?</li>

These crimes are committed for financial gain, often through deception. Historically, this term derives from a reference to the “white collars” that managers, executives, or professionals who committed these crimes wore as their everyday attire, rather than the “blue collars” of the factory workers and laborers. White-collar crimes are not typical street crimes, like burglary or robbery, and they are not person crimes, like murder or rape. Rather, the term is used to describe crime committed in the professional work environment, for the purpose of obtaining a financial reward through the use of deception. White-collar criminals frequently commit their crimes on the job, in broad daylight, while sitting at a desk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_p02">But what leads an otherwise successful businessperson or organization to commit a white-collar crime? After all, if someone is earning a good salary, or if a business is financially healthy, why would he or she choose to violate the law? While names like Kenneth Lay of Enron and Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom are virtually synonymous with corporate greed, lack of ethical decision making, and fraudulent behavior, these examples do not provide satisfactory answers to this question. Indeed, businesses must be vigilant against white-collar crime, because there is no absolute way to identify those who might turn to criminal behavior in the workplace. White-collar crime can involve fraud or larceny, organized crime, cybercrime, and environmental crime.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p13">Consider another type of fraud, where the deception is perhaps better hidden. Bernie Madoff committed massive fraud in a scheme known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ponzi scheme</a><span class="glossdef">A pyramid scheme, which is a particular type of fraud.</span></span>. A Ponzi scheme is a pyramid scheme, where people pay in. Those at the top of the pyramid may receive something that appears to be a return on their investment, but those at the bottom do not. This is because the funds paid in by those at the bottom are used to pay the people at the top. Those who operate Ponzi schemes generally solicit investors, and those who invest in such schemes are expecting a legitimate return on investment (ROI). However, the master of the Ponzi scheme does not really invest the funds. He simply takes them, and keeps his early “investors” happy by bringing in new investors, whose money he gives to the old investors as their ROI. This allows the Ponzi scheme to continue, because it appears from the outside that investors are receiving a legitimate ROI. The problem is that the capital contributions eventually disappear, since they are never invested but are simply used by the criminal for his own purposes, including covering his tracks for as long as possible by paying investors with fake ROI payments as necessary. To continue, the pyramid must get bigger and bigger. That is because new investors must be attracted to keep the cash flow going. Eventually, of course, pyramids will eventually collapse under their own unsustainable structure.

Interestingly, Harry Markopolos, a financial analyst, flagged Madoff’s actions to the SEC as statistically impossible long before Madoff was caught. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_n05">Note 10.59 "Hyperlink: Too Good to Be True? Statistically Impossible Returns"</a> to watch Mr. Markopolos explain this by using sports analogies. This raises interesting legal questions regarding whether the SEC is proactive enough. The SEC actions are often reactive, responding to a situation after it happened.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p17">Investors aren’t the only potential victims of white-collar crime. Owners of businesses are also potential victims. For example, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embezzlement</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when someone takes property that was in his or her possession lawfully and then converts it to his or her own use.</span></span> is a common crime, and it occurs when someone takes property that was in his or her possession lawfully and then converts it to his or her own use. As you can see, Bernie Madoff was an embezzler because he lawfully had possession of his clients’ money, but then he wrongfully converted those funds to his own use, rather than exercising his fiduciary duty to his clients. Embezzlement differs from larceny, because larceny requires the trespassory taking of property with the intent to deprive the owner of the property. In other words, in a larceny, the thief is not supposed to have possession of the property to begin with. Someone who embezzles something, however, has the right to be in possession of the property to start with but then wrongfully converts it (steals it) for his or her own use. Embezzlement strategies can involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">forgery</a><span class="glossdef">A form of counterfeiting.</span></span>, which is counterfeiting someone else’s signature or other document. It can also involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wire fraud</a><span class="glossdef">Fraud committed over interstate wire, such as by telephone.</span></span> if the embezzlement uses electronic communications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_004">18 U.S.C. §1343.</span> Refer again to <a class="xref" href="lau-ch10_s01#lau-ch10_s01_n02">Note 10.4 "Hyperlink: Thefts, Skimming, Fake Invoices, Oh My!"</a> to learn about many different embezzlement schemes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p01">While the term “organized crime” often summons images of the mafia, that is not the only type of organized criminal activity in this country. Consider the recent case against Pfizer, which settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009. Pfizer’s subsidiaries, Pharmacia and Upjohn, had been selling pharmaceuticals “off-label” in doses and for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and it had been providing kickbacks to physicians to prescribe those drugs. The subsidiaries agreed to plead guilty to misbranding with the intent to defraud or mislead. They paid a criminal fine of more than one billion dollars and forfeited their profits from their illegal activities. Not only did they plead guilty to a criminal violation, but they also had to pay a hefty penalty for violating civil law, particularly related to paying kickbacks to physicians.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_005">FBI Press Release, “The Case Against Pfizer: A Record $2.3 Billion Settlement,” September 2, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov/page2/sept09/pfizer_settlement_090209.html">http://www.fbi.gov/page2/sept09/pfizer_settlement_090209.html</a> (accessed September 27, 2010).</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Kickbacks</a><span class="glossdef">Incentive payments that are given to someone who makes decisions to encourage others to pay for something.</span></span> are incentive payments that are given to someone who makes decisions to encourage others to pay for something. The repercussions of this conviction are certainly felt by those who were without knowledge of these acts, such as the shareholders and many employees, not to mention the patients who were subjected to off-label marketing in the contexts of what otherwise should have been trusting relationships with their physicians.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal statute that penalizes racketeering activities.</span></span> is a federal statute that, if violated, can add substantial prison time to a convicted criminal’s sentence. Even if someone is not per se involved with organized crime, RICO charges can be brought against a defendant who has violated the statute. This statute punishes those engaged in a pattern (at least two) of racketeering activities—which include a wide range of activities typically associated with organized crime—over a ten-year period,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn10_006">18 U.S.C. §1961(5).</span> when funds from those activities were used to maintain, operate, or acquire a legitimate business. Racketeering activities include crimes such as loan-sharking, bookmaking, money laundering, counterfeiting, smuggling, blackmailing, human trafficking, and other similar crimes. Although RICO was written to target traditional organized crime, less than 10 percent of RICO cases filed have been against the mafia. RICO is now used against insurance companies, stock brokerages, tobacco companies, banks, and other large commercial enterprises. RICO also has a civil provision allowing a competitor to file RICO charges, which come with triple damages if the suit is successful.</p>

However, companies should be very careful in relying on the grease payment exception, since such payments are legal under the FCPA only if they are also legal under the laws of the country where the grease payments take place, and there are very few jurisdictions (if any) where they are indeed legal. States also have statutes against bribery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p04">Money laundering occurs when funds gained from illegal activities are processed through a seemingly legitimate business to “clean” the source of those funds. For example, someone who received $10,000 for criminal activities will need to “clean” the money to be able to use it legitimately. One way this can be done is by setting up a business that handles a lot of cash, which appears to be a legitimate business. This business can overstate its earnings by $10,000 over time by running the money through its books, thereby “cleaning” the funds. For example, if the business was a tavern, and the tavern grossed $12,000 per month, the ill-gotten $10,000 could be spread out over ten months by having the business claim that it grossed $13,000 each month. In that way, the ten thousand would eventually be “laundered” or “cleaned,” because it will appear to be money received by the legitimate business itself.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p05">In that example, if someone found out about this money laundering operation and threatened to go to the authorities unless a payment was given to him to keep quiet, then that would be a form of extortion known as blackmail. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Blackmail</a><span class="glossdef">A form of extortion that occurs when someone threatens to reveal a harmful truth, such as involvement in criminal activity, but agrees to remain silent if he is paid.</span></span> occurs when someone threatens to reveal a harmful truth, such as involvement in criminal activity, but agrees to remain silent if paid. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Extortion</a><span class="glossdef">When someone obtains property through coercion by threat of some future action.</span></span> is when someone obtains property through coercion. Another example of extortion is when a neighborhood gang extracts “protection payments” from local businesses. Essentially, the gang requires payment from local businesses periodically, and if the business refuses to pay, then the gang injures the business or its owner in some way, such as through vandalism or battery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p06">In organized crime cases, there can be strong incentives for people not to do the right thing. Maybe they are afraid of punishment by the government. But they may also fear punishment from their organized crime communities. In such cases, sometimes people do not tell the truth when they should. Someone who lies under oath, even if he or she thinks there’s a good reason to do so, has committed the crime of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perjury</a><span class="glossdef">Lying under oath.</span></span>.

The Environmental Protection Agency enforces federal environmental statutes, including those that carry a criminal penalty. Many corporations have been convicted of environmental crimes. For instance, corporations that illegally dump toxic substances into waterways, illegally harm endangered species or those species’ habitats, or trade in illegal substances that have been banned due to their propensity to cause great harm to the environment are all engaged in environmental crimes. U.S. federal environmental statutes that carry criminal penalties include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, state environmental law statutes frequently carry criminal penalties as well.</p>

The sentence included a five-year probation for the business, a half-million-dollar criminal fine, and a four-hundred-thousand-dollar payment to a nonprofit organization. The company distributed this illegal substance throughout the United States, which was an action condemned as undermining global environmental efforts to reduce ozone damage for personal gain.</p>

            <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s02_s02_p02">Crime is a very important consideration in the business world. White-collar crimes are particularly insidious because white-collar criminals work from the inside, can be difficult to spot since they often hold positions of trust, and use deception as their primary tool. Blue-collar crimes also pose substantial risk of loss for businesses. Fraud, cybercrime, environmental crime, organized crime, and various forms of property crimes are all serious threats to businesses. Crime carries high personal costs not only to the individuals involved in the misconduct but also to society at large, including the corporations and others who depend on those corporations.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s03_p01">Businesses can engage in affirmative actions to reduce criminal liability. Likewise, individuals do not have to sit by passively if they know that criminal activity is afoot. This section addresses specific strategies and laws that can help combat crime in the business world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s03_p02">Businesses should conduct annual training sessions, such as ethics training, to help ensure good workplace ethics. They should develop company-wide codes of ethics, which serve as the organizational commitment to ethical behavior. This can go far toward developing a corporate culture that values ethical behavior and condemns unethical actions, by providing leadership that serves as positive role models for all employees. Some companies, such as Boeing, have instituted an ethics hotline, which allows employees to anonymously report unethical behavior so that it can be investigated. Additionally, federal sentencing guidelines in place for organizations state that organizations that maintain a rigorous compliance program to detect and report violations of the law, and voluntarily disclose those violations when they occur, are eligible for significantly reduced sentences and fines.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s03_p03">Sometimes, of course, things still go wrong. A person who observes illegal behavior in the workplace may choose not to participate in that illegal behavior. Such a person can even choose to become a whistleblower. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Whistleblowers</a><span class="glossdef">People who report the illegal activity of their employers or of their organization to authorities.</span></span> are people who report the illegal activity of their employers or of their organization to authorities. Typically, the whistleblowers have observed some wrongdoing that may harm others, and they decide to “blow the whistle” to protect the potential victims or to simply stop the wrongdoing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s03_p04">Whistleblowers face many challenges in the workplace, not the least of which is the stigma associated with blowing the whistle. Paradoxically, even though the whistleblower may be preventing harm to innocent people, other employees may view the whistleblower as someone who has betrayed the organization. Because of this, whistleblowers are often placed in a terrible ethical dilemma, because while they may observe wrongdoing, they may not feel comfortable in reporting the illegal activity. They may fear losing their job or not being able to find a new job. Prospects of losing one’s status, friends, or reputation can prevent many people from blowing the whistle, even though they may wish the behavior to stop.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s03_p05">Whistleblower protection laws prohibit retaliatory action against whistleblowers. Some statutes contain whistleblower protection provisions. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains whistleblower protection, but the statute is not entirely devoted to whistleblower protection. The False Claims Act provides that anyone who blows the whistle on a federal contractor committing fraud on the government can personally receive a portion of any amount recovered, up to 25 percent. Despite these protections, many real-world whistleblowers have discovered that the laws are cold comfort for the realities that face them after whistle is blown. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch10_s03_n02">Note 10.93 "Hyperlink: Whistleblower Law Blog"</a>, which lists many of the statutes under which whistleblower protections are offered.</p>

        <p class="para" id="lau-ch10_s03_p08">Corporations can also avail themselves of safe harbor provisions in certain statutes. If they see criminal behavior and realize that they may be implicated in the criminal behavior, they can report certain actions to authorities, which will allow them to receive a lesser penalty, or no penalty at all. Only a few criminal statutes have safe harbor provisions, however.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">10.4</span> Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch10_s04_p01">Crime statistics in the United States illustrate the sobering reality that businesses must maintain vigilance against criminal activities. Threats arise from the inside—from employees, officers, directors, and employees—as well as from the outside, from professional or opportunistic criminals. It makes good business sense to practice both offensive and defensive strategies to stave off these threats. This can best be accomplished through proactive policies that encourage ethical behavior, encourage whistleblowing, and create disincentives for violating the law in the form of company policies, training programs, and codes of ethics.</p>
