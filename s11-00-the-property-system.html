        <p class="para" id="lau-ch08_p01">After reading this chapter, you should understand different classifications of property, including personal property and real property, as well as different types of interests in real property. You will also learn about methods of acquisition and transfer of real property. At the conclusion of this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="lau-ch08_l01">
            <li>What is the difference between real property and personal property?</li>
            <li>How is ownership interest in personal property transferred?</li>
            <li>What interests in real property exist?</li>
            <li>How is real property acquired and transferred?</li>
            <li>What legal relationships exist between landlord and tenants?</li>
        </ol>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch08_p02">The concepts of property and ownership are fundamental to any society. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Property</a><span class="glossdef">Tangible and intangible items that can be owned.</span></span> refers to tangible and intangible items that can be owned. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ownership</a><span class="glossdef">The right to possess, and the right to exclude others from use or possession.</span></span> is a concept that means the right to exclude others. Disputes over both have been at the root of conflicts and wars since time immemorial. Without laws to protect property ownership, the stability of our society would be seriously undermined. For example, if law did not protect ownership interests in property, then people would have to protect their property themselves. This means that people would have to hire their own security forces to protect their property, or they would have to stand guard over their property personally. It would be difficult to get anything else done. Such a system would likely result in the development of powerful factions. Those with the greatest power would dominate property ownership, and weaker members of society would be at their mercy. For example, one of the opening scenes of the movie <em class="emphasis">Black Hawk Down</em> illustrates a U.N. food distribution point in Mogadishu, Somalia. As depicted in that scene, people were waiting to receive the distribution of food, but a powerful, armed faction seized the cargo and opened fire on them. Obviously, such a system of property ownership would prove to be very unsettling, and it would lead to great instability in our economic system.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch08_p03">Our legal system creates a peaceful means to acquire, retain, and divest of property, and to settle property disputes. It punishes those who operate outside of those rules. Indeed, those who do not acquire property lawfully or who do not settle property disputes within the confines of our legal system are subjected to criminal and civil penalties.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch08_p04">In the United States, our legal system ensures the ability to own property to everyone that the system recognizes can own property. Of course, not everyone has always been able to own property. The history of the United States is replete with examples of exclusion from the property ownership system. For example, at various times and in different ways, married women, African Americans, and people of Chinese and Japanese descent have been subject to restrictions regarding the ownership of real property. Because property law is a state law issue, those restrictions and exclusions varied from state to state. Today, no such restrictions exist. Indeed, even a nonhuman <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">legal person</a><span class="glossdef">A human being or entity, such as a corporation or government, that is recognized as a possessor of certain legal rights.</span></span>, such as a corporation, can own property. However, some biological beings cannot own property. For example, nonhuman animals cannot own real or personal property in our legal system. This is because nonhuman animals are not legal persons. However, a nonhuman animal can be a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beneficiary</a><span class="glossdef">A person or entity that receives the benefit of a contract, trust, or other legal instrument.</span></span> of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trust</a><span class="glossdef">A legal instrument created for the benefit of a beneficiary.</span></span> in many states.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch08_p05">Moreover, not everything is subject to ownership. For instance, the human body cannot be owned by another, though historically, in legal systems that recognized slavery, certain human bodies could be owned. Today, public policy discourages the treatment of human body as personal property, rendering “gifts” of body parts to specific individuals largely suspect. For example, organ donees may have a need for an organ destined for transplant into their own bodies after the donor’s body dies, but they do not have a legal right to it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lau-fn08_001"><em class="emphasis">Colavito v. New York Organ Donor Network</em>, 2006 NY Slip Op. 09320 (NY App. Ct. 2006).</span> Similarly, the question regarding whether human genes may be owned through patent is a hot topic. Check out <a class="xref" href="#lau-ch08_n02">Note 8.7 "Hyperlink: When DNA Is Isolated from the Human Body, Is It Subject to Ownership by Patent?"</a> and consider whether the benefits of patentability of certain body parts, like genes, might outstrip the concerns surrounding ownership of the human body.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lau-ch08_p07">Before engaging in questions regarding the evolution of property ownership rights, it is necessary to lay the foundation for studying this fascinating area of law. It is this foundation to which we now turn. This chapter explores the differences between real and personal property, and the acquisition, transfer, and protection of real and personal property interests. Additionally, it examines different interests in real property.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lau-ch08_p08">The U.S. legal system protects the rights to own, acquire, protect, and divest of real and personal property. These protections are necessary for peaceful civil society. Historically, different groups of people have been subjected to discriminatory practices—both legal and illegal—regarding property ownership. Today, legal persons can own, acquire, transfer, and sell property. However, not everything is subject to property ownership concepts.</p>
